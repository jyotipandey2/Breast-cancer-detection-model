# Breast-cancer-detection-model
Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases among women worldwide. It is considered one of the leading causes of death among women. Deep Learning techniques have been previously proposed for the same.
Here's a implementation of such a model proposed in "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262349". The model uses U-net for segmentation of images and a deep CNN for detection of cancer
disease using supervised learning.
Further I implemented a breast cancer detection classcification model on the same datset using pre-trained Alexnet.
